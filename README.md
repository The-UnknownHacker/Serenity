# Serenity

**Serenity** is a drumpad or macropad designed with musicians in mind.  
Instead of using traditional switches or buttons, it uses a **copper layer on the PCB** to detect touch input.

Powered by an **ESP32-S3 devkit**, Serenity can store sound files on a **microSD card** and output audio through a **headphone jack**.

It features **2 configurable buttons** that let you switch between sound "layers" â€” allowing you to play many more sounds than just 8.  
For example, with 4 layers, you can trigger **32 unique sounds**.

I built **Serenity** after being inspired by those expensive drumpads used for triggering sound effects.  
They often cost a fortune, so I created **Serenity** to cost **under $50 USD**, without sacrificing creativity or functionality.
