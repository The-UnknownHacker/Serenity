# June 24th: Started choosing components and integrating them with the PCB

I started to choose the components that I am going to use - /
First I decided on using the Xiao ESP32-s3 board but now I might use a normal ESP32-s3 devboard as I need more gpio
The parts I have decided for now are

- ESP32-s3 devboard
- Micro SD Card Slot
- Headphone Jack
- MAX98357A Audio DAC
- Everything will be powered by the ESP's USB C port

I also started to wire up most of the circuit and I think I have finished the first version of the schematic. 
This is a rough schematic and I will need to double check if it fully works or not.

**Total time spent: 8h**


# June 26th : Assigned all the footprints and started the PCB with rough routing

Today I started a rough PCB design and diagram to visualize the basic design.
As of now my design is still missing key resisistors and capacitors and is not in working shape just yet (just a mockup)
