# June 24th: Started choosing components and integrating them with the PCB

I started to choose the components that I am going to use - /
First I decided on using the Xiao ESP32-s3 board but now I might use a normal ESP32-s3 devboard as I need more gpio
The parts I have decided for now are

- ESP32-s3 devboard
- Micro SD Card Slot
- Headphone Jack
- MAX98357A Audio DAC
- Everything will be powered by the ESP's USB C port

I also started to wire up most of the circuit and I think I have finished the first version of the schematic. 
This is a rough schematic and I will need to double check if it fully works or not.
